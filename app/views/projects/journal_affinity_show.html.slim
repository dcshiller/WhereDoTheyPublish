      | The affinity rating of a pair of journals is a measure of the likelihood of a given author to publish in both of them. 
      | The rating is equal to the percentage of authors of smaller publication who have published in the larger publication. 
      | Authors with five or fewer publications are excluded and book reviews are ignored.
